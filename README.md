# Color Clock

This application uses the event loop and hexadecimal conversion to change the
background color of your browser window every second. The current time is linked
to a hex code that's then linked to a CSS style. The result is an aesthetically
pleasing color clock with a dynamic progress bar that grows by the second. Enjoy!
